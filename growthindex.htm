<b><font size=+2>Economic Growth Workshop</font></b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>This is the website for the Economics of Growth Workshop. During Spring
Semester 2007 we meet each Thursday at 5:45PM in 413 Kern (except for April
2).
<p>The purpose of the workshop is to study recent work in the Economics
of Growth, both theory and empirical, for graduate students interested
in this subject.
<p>Our plan is to have weekly meetings. Each week we will discuss a different
paper that will be presented by a graduate student. All participants must
read the papers in advance.
<p>All attendees must participate – no free riding is allowed. Papers for
discussion will be chosen by graduate students and by faculty. Below we
present a sample of some papers we think will be relevant.
<p>All participants should read Lant Pritchett's article on <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2006/03/pritchet.htm">modern
growth theory</a>.
