<P>1. Describe the main features of the privatization process in Russia.
What are the major hurdles that must be overcome for privatization to be
successful? Be specific.

<P>2. Describe the primary methods of privatization that have been used
in transition economies. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages
of these various methods?

<P>3. The current market value of shares in privatized Russian enterprises
suggests that many enterprises are "under-valued" when compared with "similar"
enterprises in western economies. What are the most important factors responsible
for this "under-valuation?" Which of these do you think is most important?
Explain.
<BLOCKQUOTE>a) To what extent does this under-valuation represent a problem?
Is it meaningful to speak of undervalued assets in a market economy?&nbsp;
What does this actually mean, if anything, economically?
<BR>b) What factors can be undertaken to enhance the market values of Russian
enterprises?
<BR>c) Why might enterprise directors resist some of these policies?</BLOCKQUOTE>
4. "The primary problem of the transition is that anti-social behavior
is contagious. If only a few people (enterprises) engage in such behavior
it is easy to eliminate, but when the vast majority of society behaves
this way the State may collapse." Discuss, providing specific examples
wherever possible. What is the economic interpretation of this statement?
How important is this problem in the transition? What specific features
of the transition can be explained by this phenomenon? Be precise.

<P>5. Two basic viewpoints can be distinguished with respect to privatization.
One view suggests that the primary problem of privatization is to create
proper incentives within enterprises, primarily through privatization itself.
The other view suggests that the key element is to improve the market infrastructure
within which enterprises operate. Discuss the relative merits of the two
views. What do you think is the most important element for transition?

<P>6. Some observers of the Russian transition claim that the primary explanation
of the failure of stabilization was a "lack of credibility on the part
of the reformers." Why might credibility be an important factor in stabilization?
Why might this explanation be deemed to be too simple? Discuss.

<P>7. What is meant by the term "network capital?" Why, if at all, is this
concept useful for studying enterprises in transition? What does this have
to do with the notion of disorganization?

<P>8. "The essence of transition is the creation of new relationships between
enterprises, based not on the legacy of central planning, but on market-type
relationships." Explain the logic of this sentence. Can you provide an
explanation of why enterprises may be reluctant to leave their <I>historic</I>
ties? What factors in transition make it more costly to create new relationships?

<P>9. Privatization has been more successful in the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Russia than in Poland. Yet Poland is the transition economy that returned
to positive economic growth first, and that has the highest growth rate
of output. What does this tell us about the importance of privatization
in the transition process? How has Poland achieved their turnaround; that
is, what is the Polish secret to success?

<P>10. What are the major theories that explain the collapse of output
in transition economies?
<BLOCKQUOTE>i) Why is the collapse of output in the early stages of transition
a theoretical curiosity?
<BR>ii) Why might the collapse in measured output overstate the true effect?
<BR>iii) Which explanations of the output fall make the most sense? Explain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
11. What is the difference between <I>corporatization </I>and <I>privatization</I>?
Be as precise as possible.

<P>12. Why is inside-ownership a potential problem in privatization? Under
what conditions will inside ownership prevent efficient takeovers of enterprises?
Explain. What implications does this have for the design of corporate governance
in transition economies?

<P>13. To what extent is there a meaningful tradeoff between efficiency
and equity in the design of privatization programs?
