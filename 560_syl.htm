<h1>Econ 560A: Development Economics</h1>
<b>Professor Barry W. Ickes</b><p>

<b>Winter 1996</b><p>

<center><b>Introduction</b></center>
<p>

	This is the first module of the Development Economics sequence, the introduction to development economics. 
In this part, we will focus on macroeconomic aspects of development --growth and finance-- and on theoretical
approaches to development economics, especially organizational issues.  In the last module of the sequence (in
Econ 560B) we will study transition.<p>

	The discussion may resemble the following outline.<p>

<p>

<b>1.  Introduction to Development Economics</b><p>

<p>

	What is development economics about?  Is there a need for a distinct field of development economics? What
are the key differences between developing and developed countries?  What is the nature of the transition that
is implied?  What approaches are useful in studying development? What, if any, lessons from western
experience are relevant to the problems of developing countries?<p>

	This section will review, briefly, the history of development economics, and review some of the accumulated
wisdom.<p>

2</b>.  <b>Development and Growth</b>	<p>

	What is the difference between growth and development?  What can growth theory tell us about development? 
There is much current interest in endogenous growth theory.  We will explore the relationship between the
"new growth theory" and development, and ask the question:  Does the "new growth theory" help explain the
patterns of development we actually observe? <p>

<b>3.  Finance and Economic Development</b><p>

	What is the role of financial development in economic development?  Recent empirical work seems to suggest
that financial institutions play an important role in explaining economic growth.  What aids or inhibits the
development of financial institutions?  Are their specific problems in developing countries that inhibit the
development of financial institutions?  How important is this in explaining performance in LDC's?<p>

4.  Complementarities, the Economics of the Big Push and Hysteresis<p>

	</b>The idea that developing economies must reach some critical mass so that the economy can take-off has played
an important role in the field.  These ideas initially took the form of the "big push" and unbalanced growth.  In
modern terms we refer to problems of complementarities and multiple equilibria. Hysteresis and path
dependence may play an important role in development economics.<b><p>

5.  The Economics of Organization and Economic Development</b><p>

<p>

	How do economic organizations differ in developing and developed countries?  The economics of organization
explains the development of economic institutions as means of economizing on transactions costs.  Are their
specific problems faced by developing countries that inhibit the development of economic institutions?  How
does this impact on economic development?  A theory of economic organization is crucial for development
economics because of the wide variety of experiences observed.  <p>
