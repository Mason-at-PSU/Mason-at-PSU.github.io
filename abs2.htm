Abstract: We examine the critical problem of inter-enterprise arrears (overdue payments for goods and services) in Russia which undermines the transition to a market economy and to privatization.  In addition to analyzing the causes of the mounting accumulation of debt and highlighting the financial problems of enterprises coping with the crisis, the authors examine the anatomy of present-day banking and extension of credit to finance production in the former USSR.
