<P><B>Introduction</B>

<P>With the demise of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, former socialist
economies are in the process of transition from centrally-planned to market
economies. Transition is a comprehensive change, involving all aspects
of the economy, including labor markets, capital markets, and the organization
of industry, especially privatization. The focus of this course is on the
experience of economies in transition and the problems encountered. Special
emphasis will be given to the experience of Russia and the other countries
of the former Soviet Union. In addition to Central Europe and the former
Soviet Union, we will also examine the experience of China.

<P>I have ordered the following texts, which are valuable works on this
subject. I do not list them as required; it is left up to you to decide
what to read:

<P>Gros, Daniel, and Alfred Steinherr, <I>Winds of Change: Economic Transition
in Central and Eastern Europe. </I>New York, Longman, 1995. (Gross &amp;
Steinherr)

<P>The World Bank, <I>From Plan to Market: World Development Report 1996</I>.
New York, Oxford University Press, 1996. (WDR)

<P>Important articles are listed below, and copies will be kept on reserve
in Pattee Library. Some additional materials will be available (these are
marked with the notation WEB) on the web at the site for this course: <A HREF="econ372home.htm">http://www.personal.psu.edu/i04/econ372home.htm</A>.
Materials will be added to the web list periodically, so you should check
it for new items.

<P><I>Course Requirements</I>

<P>There will be two midterms and a final exam. The weight for each midterm
will be about 30%. The final will be worth approximately 40%. The dates
of the midterms will be Thursday, October 8, 1998 and Thursday, November
19, 1998. The exams will not be multiple choice, and bluebooks will be
required for the midterms and final. Review questions will be given out
prior to the exam.

<P><B>Prerequisites</B>: Econ 2 or Econ 4 or Econ 14.
